# Object-detection
This project demonstrates object detection and tracking using the YOLOv8 model via the Ultralytics framework. It includes three Python scripts to detect objects from a webcam stream, a static image, and a recorded video file. Bounding boxes with class IDs and confidence scores are overlaid on detected objects.
